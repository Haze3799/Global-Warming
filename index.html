        use, washing laundry with cold as aposed to hot water and hanging clothes to dry instead of using the tumple
        dryer. These are all extreamly easy and efficiant of saving energy.</p>
      <h4>transportation</h4>
      <p>Most vehicles use petrol or diesel. By walking or cycling instead of driving we can reduce the amount of green
        house gass emissions, and also help your health and fitness.</p>
